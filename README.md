# OLS-REGRESSION

Assessment of whether overall customer satisfaction (“lvsat ”) can be explained by customer expectations (“ lvexpect ”), perceived value ("lvvalue ”), and customer ("complaints lvcomp ”)

Results:
R Square indicates that 3 predictors jointly explain 61% of the variance. Adjusted for their number,the predictors explain 61% of the dependent variable.

Overall model is significant  F(3,1635)= 847.453, p <0.001--> Atleast one independent variable is related to the dependent variable(can explain the dependency).

Model Interpretion:

Unstandardized  regression coefficient shows the absolute change in customer  satisfaction depending on a change in the predictors.

The standardized coefficient(Beta) provides a comparable measure for the effects(required when predictors are measured on different scales).Customer satisfaction is largely related to perceived value (beta =0.683) followed by customer expectation (beta = 0.163) then customer complaints = -0.38
